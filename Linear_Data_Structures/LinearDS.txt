Linear Data Structures:
1) Array
2) Linked List
3) Stack
4) Queue

Breakdowns:
Array ->
    -Accessing Time: O(1)
        -> Elements are stored at contiguous locations
    -Sequential Search Time: O(n)
    -Binary Search Time: O(log n)
        -> If Array is sorted
    -Insertion Time: O(n)
        -> Worst case occurs when insertion happens at the 
        Beginning of an array and requires shifting all of the elements
    -Deletion Time: O(n)
        -> The worst case occurs when deletion happens at the Beginning of an
        array and requires shifting all of the elements
