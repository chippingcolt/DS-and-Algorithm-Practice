Goal:
Algorithm directory showcases examples of popular/practical algorithms implemented from scratch and in personally unique ways.

Data Structure directory showcases examples of time complexity among different 
data structures as well as building them from scratch.

Overall, this repository is for practicing algorithms and data structure efficiency in Java and coding standards.

Enjoy :)

Implementations:
Each section will have the following:
- A local read me
- A test file to verify time and practice java unit testing
- Abstraction will be implemented
- Java's native implementations of data structures
- Popular Java standards
